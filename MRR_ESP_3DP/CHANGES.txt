Changes
-------

v0.5
----
- Added jumpers to allow TMC drivers to be used.
  - Connect or disconnect MS1, MS2, MS3 jumpers for normal microstepping control (A4988, etc.).
  - Connect RST to SLP for normal drivers like A4988.
  - Connect MS1, MS2, MS3, RST jumpers to TMC side for TMC2130.
  - Connect RST jumper to TMC side for TMC2208; MS1 and MS2 can still be used for microstepping.
  - Connect TMC_SEL jumper to SPI for TMC2130, and UART for TMC2208.
  - When using TMC2130 SPI, connect X, Y, Z, or E0 pin on CS_PIN row to the pin that is to be used for CS on the ESP32 breakout row.
- Fixed missing nets on v0.4 PCB.

v0.4
----
- Renamed power inputs to VIN and VBED.
- Changed reverse current protection diodes to parallel instead of series.

v0.3
----
- Initial release on Github.
- Changed to use 5.08mm pitch terminals instead of 7.62mm pitch terminals to reduce footprint.
- Added AUX1 connector.

v0.2
----
- Overhaul of v0.1 to use ESP32-WROOM-32 module instead of development boards.
- Added design consideration to fit within 100mm x 100mm of PCB area.
- Support for 4 stepper drivers, single hot end, single heat bed, single part cooling fan.
- Pinout based on current (2018-11-25) pins_ESP32.h of Marlin firmware (bugsfix-2.0.x branch).

v0.1
----
- Based on 2 x LOLIN32 development boards, with one running Marlin firmware, and another running ESP3D to provide user interface.
