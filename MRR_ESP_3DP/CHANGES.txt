Changes
-------

v0.7
----
- Added capacitors to endstops for filtering.
- Changed thermistor resistors to 4.7K (original 47K was mistake).
- Removed TMC2208 PD_UART jumpers as the current setup does not have enough sets of TX/RX pins to support at least 2 drivers (X and Y).
- Removed button for IO0.
- Renamed "EN" button to "BOOT" button.
- Added capacitors to 3.3V regulator for more stable power.
- Added 5V regulator to regulate VCC supply to 74HCT02. This is needed because the 74HCT02 can only handle up to 5.5V, and any input voltage fluctuation beyond 5.5V will cause the 74HCT02 to fail, and it will then supply voltage to the MOSFET gates, turning on the MOSFETs and possibly causing a fire.

v0.6
----
- Changed capacitors for motor drivers to 100uF.
- Changed bed mosfet to IRLS3034PBF, which has a lower on-resistance at 4.5V.
- Used 74HCT02 to drive mosfets.

v0.5
----
- Added jumpers to allow TMC drivers to be used.
  - Connect or disconnect MS1, MS2, MS3 jumpers for normal microstepping control (A4988, etc.).
  - Connect RST to SLP for normal drivers like A4988.
  - Connect MS1, MS2, MS3, RST jumpers to TMC side for TMC2130.
  - Connect RST jumper to TMC side for TMC2208; MS1 and MS2 can still be used for microstepping.
  - Connect TMC_SEL jumper to SPI for TMC2130, and UART for TMC2208.
  - When using TMC2130 SPI, connect X, Y, Z, or E0 pin on CS_PIN row to the pin that is to be used for CS on the ESP32 breakout row.
- Fixed missing nets on v0.4 PCB.

v0.4
----
- Renamed power inputs to VIN and VBED.
- Changed reverse current protection diodes to parallel instead of series.

v0.3
----
- Initial release on Github.
- Changed to use 5.08mm pitch terminals instead of 7.62mm pitch terminals to reduce footprint.
- Added AUX1 connector.

v0.2
----
- Overhaul of v0.1 to use ESP32-WROOM-32 module instead of development boards.
- Added design consideration to fit within 100mm x 100mm of PCB area.
- Support for 4 stepper drivers, single hot end, single heat bed, single part cooling fan.
- Pinout based on current (2018-11-25) pins_ESP32.h of Marlin firmware (bugsfix-2.0.x branch).

v0.1
----
- Based on 2 x LOLIN32 development boards, with one running Marlin firmware, and another running ESP3D to provide user interface.
